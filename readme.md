# Jedi Academy Modding Guide (in progress)

This project aims to collect everything about Jedi Academy Modding in a single place. There are plenty of individual tutorials and explanations scattered over the internet, but much of it is limited to a single area.

## Goals

* Provide clear paths for people looking to learn about a specific area, like mapping, modeling or coding.
  * Additionally provide video versions.
* Make the required technical background easy to understand, like explaining the BSP tree, what it's good for, and how achieve optimal results using it.
* Cross-reference the relevant bits of code.
